## Memory Storages
- MAC address table ---> ternary content-addressable memory (TCAM)
- IOS resides ---> flash
- startup-configuration ---> NVRAM
- running-configuration, logs, and so on ---> DRAM (lost after reboot)

## Port configuration
- Cisco switches do not have a command to disable autonegotiation of speed and duplex. Instead, a switch port that has both speed and duplex configured disables autonegotiation.
