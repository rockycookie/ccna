# WLAN Authentication

## Open Authntication
- The only requirement is that a client must use an 802.11 authentication request
    - no other credentials are needed
- Authenticating the userâ€™s identity is handled as a true security process through other means
- No encryption

## WEP
- Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP)
- RC4 cipher algorithm (symmetric WEP key for both encryption and decryption)
    - WEP key is 
        - pre-shared
        - 40 or 104 bits long
- History
    - 2001, a number of weaknesses were discovered
    - 2004, officially deprecated

## IEEE 802.1x
- port-based access control standard
- it limits access to a network media until a client authenticates
    - establish association first, but blocking network data until authn
- sequence
    1. the client uses open authentication to associate with the AP
    2. the actual client authentication process occurs at a dedicated authentication server

## EAP
- Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)

## LEAP
- Lightweight EAP (LEAP)
- Cisco proprietary
- mutual authentication by exchanging challenge message (by successful decryption)
- dynamic WEP keys that changed frequently
- deprecated

## EAP-FAST
- EAP Flexible Authentication by Secure Tunneling (EAP-FAST)
- Authentication credentials are protected by passing a Protected Access Credential (PAC)
    - The PAC is a form of shared secret that is generated by the authntication server and used for mutual auth
- phases
    1. The PAC is generated/provisioned and installed on the client
    2. After the supplicant and AS have authenticated each other, they negotiate a Transport Layer Security (TLS) tunnel
    3. The end user can then be authenticated through the TLS tunnel for additional security
- RADIUS server could operate as an EAP-FAST server to generate PAC

## PEAP
- Protected EAP
- phases
    1. Authentication server presents a digital certificate to authenticate itself with the supplicant in the outer authentication
    2. Supplicant is satisfied with the identity of the AS
    3. Build a TLS tunnel to be used for the inner client authentication and encryption key exchange
- server is identified/authenticated by certificate with CA (outter auth)
- client is identified/authenticated by inner auth
    - client has no cert

## EAP-TLS
- the most secure wireless auth method
- each wireless client must obtain and install a certificate
    - Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) could be used to
        - supply certs
        - revoke certs
    - need to use CA as PKI
