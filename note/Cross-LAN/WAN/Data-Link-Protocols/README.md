# Data-Link Protocols for Wide Area Network

- Leased-line WANs have been an option for networks for half a century, are becoming much less common today
    - L2 protocols
        - HDLC
        - PPP
    - by todayâ€™s standards, leased-line LANs are slow, with faster speeds in the tens of megabits per second (Mbps)
- WAN links do use the same data-link protocols as Ethernet LANs, but they use additional features to make the links work over the much longer distances required for WANs
    - L2 protocol: Ethernet
    - For the first several decades of existence, Ethernet was only appropriate for LANs. The restrictions on cable lengths and devices might allow a LAN that stretched 1-2km, to support a campus LAN, but that was the limit.
    - Fiber Ethernet links (up to 70km) made it available for WAN
    - In reaclity, both endpoints connect to ISP's devices using Fiber links; for the exam, think there is a p2p fiber link connecting the two endpoints
