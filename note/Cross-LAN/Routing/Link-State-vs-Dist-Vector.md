# Linked State vs Distance Vector

## Linked State
- route with shortest path
- high demand on resources to run the algorithm
- Hello packets and LSA
    - to build and maintain topological database
- send LSA after convergence only on changes
- require a hierarchical IP adderssing scheme for optimal functionality
    - efficient route aggregation & summarization
- OSPF

## Distance Vector
- send entire routing table to a neighbour
- send entire routing table regularly
- RIP
