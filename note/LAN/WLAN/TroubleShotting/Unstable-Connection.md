# Unstable Connection

## RF signal problems
- **[Unique]** Clients connect at low data rates only
    - indicating signal strength or quality degrades
- Signal strength decreases significantly a short distance from the AP
    - normal signal propagation should provide more gradual attenuation
- Multiple retransmissions seen in packet captures

## Co-channel interference
when multiple access points operate on the same wireless channel within overlapping coverage areas, causing RF contention and degraded performance

Symptoms:
- **[Unique]** Different client devices experience the same issues in the same location
- Signal strength decreases significantly a short distance from the AP
- Multiple retransmissions seen in packet captures
